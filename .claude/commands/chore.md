# Chore Planning

Create a new plan to resolve the `Chore` using the exact specified markdown `Plan Format`. Follow the `Instructions` to create the plan use the `Relevant Files` to focus on the right files. Follow the `Report` section to properly report the results of your work.

## Variables
issue_number: $1
adw_id: $2
issue_json: $3

## Instructions

- **IMPORTANT: Execute `/enforce_no_fallback` before starting** to ensure the plan adheres to the no-fallback principle
- IMPORTANT: You're writing a plan to resolve a chore based on the `Chore` that will add value to the application.
- IMPORTANT: The `Chore` describes the chore that will be resolved but remember we're not resolving the chore, we're creating the plan that will be used to resolve the chore based on the `Plan Format` below.
- You're writing a plan to resolve a chore, it should be concise but comprehensive so we don't miss anything.
- Create the plan in the `specs/` directory with filename: `issue-{issue_number}-adw-{adw_id}-sdlc_planner-{descriptive-name}.md`
  - Replace `{descriptive-name}` with a short, descriptive name based on the chore (e.g., "update-readme", "fix-tests", "refactor-auth")
- Use the plan format below to create the plan. 
- Research the codebase and put together a plan to accomplish the chore.
- IMPORTANT: Replace every <placeholder> in the `Plan Format` with the requested value. Add as much detail as needed to accomplish the chore.
- Use your reasoning model: ULTRATHINK about the plan and the steps to accomplish the chore.
- Respect requested files in the `Relevant Files` section.
- Start your research by reading the `README.md` file.
- `adws/*.py` contain astral uv single file python scripts. So if you want to run them use `uv run <script_name>`.
- When you finish creating the plan for the chore, follow the `Report` section to properly report the results of your work.
- 

## Relevant Files

Focus on the following files:
- `README.md` - Contains the project overview and instructions.
- `app/search-page-2/index.html` - Main single-page entry point (HTML).
- `app/search-page-2/js/**` - Core JavaScript modules (app.js, supabase-api.js, filter-config.js, etc.).
- `app/src/islands/**` - React island components (SearchPage, DaySelector, GoogleMap, Header, Footer).
- `app/search-page-2/css/**` - Stylesheets (styles.css, responsive.css, ai-signup.css).
- `app/search-page-2/dist/**` - Built React component bundles.
- `adws/**` - Contains the AI Developer Workflow (ADW) scripts.

- Read `.claude/commands/conditional_docs.md` to check if your task requires additional documentation
- If your task matches any of the conditions listed, include those documentation files in the `Plan Format: Relevant Files` section of your plan

Ignore all other files in the codebase.

## Plan Format

```md
# Chore: <chore name>

## Metadata
issue_number: `{issue_number}`
adw_id: `{adw_id}`
issue_json: `{issue_json}`

## Chore Description
<describe the chore in detail>

## Relevant Files
Use these files to resolve the chore:

<find and list the files that are relevant to the chore describe why they are relevant in bullet points. If there are new files that need to be created to accomplish the chore, list them in an h3 'New Files' section.>

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers plus bullet points. use as many h3 headers as needed to accomplish the chore. Order matters, start with the foundational shared changes required to fix the chore then move on to the specific changes required to fix the chore. Your last step should be running the `Validation Commands` to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions.>

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions.

<list commands you'll use to validate with 100% confidence the chore is complete with zero regressions. every command must execute without errors so be specific about what you want to run to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions. Don't validate with curl commands.>

## Notes
<optionally list any additional notes or context that are relevant to the chore that will be helpful to the developer>
```

## Chore
Extract the chore details from the `issue_json` variable (parse the JSON and use the title and body fields).

## Report

- IMPORTANT: Return exclusively the path to the plan file created and nothing else.

# CRITICAL FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

**YOUR ENTIRE RESPONSE MUST BE ONLY THE FILE PATH.**

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Return status messages, confirmations, or explanations
- ❌ Return markdown formatting, headers, or checkmarks (✓)
- ❌ Return multiple lines of text
- ❌ Include "/enforce_no_fallback" output in your response
- ❌ Add any text before or after the file path
- ❌ Return verbose descriptions of what you did

**YOU MUST:**
- ✅ Create the spec file in specs/ directory
- ✅ Return ONLY the relative file path (e.g., `specs/issue-18-adw-dd13da8e-remove-property-type-fallback.md`)
- ✅ Ensure the path is a single line with no extra text
- ✅ No explanations, no status updates, just the path

**Example of CORRECT output (exactly like this, nothing else):**
```
specs/issue-18-adw-dd13da8e-sdlc_planner-update-readme.md
```

**Example of WRONG output (DO NOT DO THIS):**
```
✓ No fallback principle enforcement check complete
✓ Task objective is to REMOVE a fallback mechanism
✓ Ready to proceed with authentic solution
```

**REMEMBER:** After executing /enforce_no_fallback and creating the plan file, return ONLY the file path. Nothing else.
