## Expected Results
Users can easily request AI market research through an intuitive multi-step wizard with smart auto-extraction, validation, and clear feedback throughout the process.

## Test Data Requirements
- Valid Bubble.io AI research workflow endpoint
- Lottie animation JSON files accessible
- Network connectivity for submission test

## Failure Scenarios
- **Modal doesn't open**: Check `ai-signup.js` initialization and Lottie library load
- **Auto-extraction fails**: Verify regex patterns in modal component
- **API request fails**: Check Bubble.io endpoint and API key in config
- **Animations don't play**: Verify Lottie library and JSON file URLs
- **Steps don't transition**: Check wizard state management in component

## Performance Expectations
- Modal should open within 200ms
- Step transitions should be smooth (< 300ms)
- Lottie animations should play at 24-30 fps
- Auto-extraction should be instant
- Form validation should be real-time (client-side)
- Submission should complete within 3 seconds

## API Integration Details
**Endpoint**: `https://app.split.lease/api/1.1/wf/ai-market-research-signup`

**Expected Request Payload**:
```json
{
  "description": "User's freeform text...",
  "email": "sarah.johnson@example.com",
  "phone": "917-555-0123",
  "source": "search_page",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "current_filters": {...},
    "listings_viewed": [...]
  }
}
```

**Expected Response** (200 OK):
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Research request queued",
  "request_id": "req_abc123",
  "estimated_delivery": "2025-01-16T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Lottie Animation URLs
- Atom animation (white): `https://50bf0464e4735aabad1cc8848a0e8b8a.cdn.bubble.io/f1746105302928x174581704119754800/atom%20white.json`
- Success animation (if different): TBD

## Notes
This is a lead generation feature - capturing user intent and contact info for follow-up. The experience should feel magical with smart auto-extraction and smooth animations. This differentiates Split Lease as an AI-powered platform, not just a listing directory.

The multi-step wizard reduces form abandonment by breaking complex input into manageable chunks while providing progress feedback.
